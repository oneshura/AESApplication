# AES Application
---
This repository contains a simple application, written in Python and inspired by Veracrypt, that encrypts and decrypts a selected file via AES. 
The GUI was implemented using Tkinter, a popular and built-in Python library.

# Important Note 
This program is a prototype, so there exists many bugs, and its functionality is not there yet.

# Usage 
---
## Encryption
Select a file, then encrypt it, and provide a key. 

## Decryption
Likewise, select a file, then decrypt it, and provide the exact key.

# Dependencies 
---
- Python 3.x
- Pyzipper

# Final Project for Information Assurance and Security
---
This application was developed as one of the applications proposed for the final project of Information Assurance and Security. It demonstrates the implementation and functionality of cryptography using AES.
